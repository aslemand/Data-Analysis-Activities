# Activity 2 - Exploring Quantitative Data

## Context of Data

The [**Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)**](http://www.oecd.org/about/) gathers various information regarding OECD countries and its partners to promote policies that aim to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. From the **Better Life Index (BLI, 2021)**, a program conducted by OECD, you will analyze a quantitative variable named **Social Network Support**. This variable reflects the percentage of males and females aged 15 years and over in 41 OECD countries who perceive their social network as having relatives or friends that they can count on to help them in times of need and trouble.

## R Setup

To set up and use R for this activity, follow the general instructions provided here:  
[**How to Access and Use R for Data Analysis Activities**](#how-to-set-up-r-for-data-analysis-activities).

Once youâ€™ve set up your project and loaded the provided files, proceed with the activity-specific instructions below.

## Activity Instructions

1. Open the R script `Social.R` and run it line by line in RStudio.
2. Begin by reading/importing the data file `Social.csv` into R.
3. Examine the data structure and variables using `str()` and summary statistics functions.
4. Create side-by-side boxplots to compare distributions of **Social Network Support** percentages for males and females.
5. Modify the plot title (line 86 in the R script) to include your last name. For example:
   ```{r, eval = FALSE}
   box.plot <- box.plot + labs(title = "Boxplot of Data Constructed by You")
   ```

6. Save the boxplot as a `.jpeg` or `.png` file.

## Related Questions

After completing the activity, answer the following questions using your results:

1. Refer to your statistical analysis of percentages of perceived social network support for males and females. Use side-by-side boxplots and summary statistics to compare the distributions.  
   - Compare the shapes, centers, and spreads of both distributions.  
   - Identify potential outliers using the 1.5IQR rule. For any outlier(s), determine how many standard deviations they are away from the overall mean of the distribution.

2. Use the boxplot and summary statistics for the differences between females' and males' percentages of perceived social network support (in each country) to describe what this plot reveals that the side-by-side boxplots do not.  
   - Discuss the shape, center, and spread of the differences.  
   - Identify suspect outliers using the 1.5IQR rule and calculate their deviation from the overall mean.  
   - Explain why the boxplot of differences is more insightful for understanding differences between males and females across OECD countries.

## Submission Instructions

- Save your boxplot of differences in percentages of perceived social support network as a `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` file.
- Share your file with your instructor or teaching assistant for feedback or assessment.
