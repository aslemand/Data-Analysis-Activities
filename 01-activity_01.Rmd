# Activity 1 - Exploring Categorical Data

## Context of Data

The [**Survey of Consumer Finances** (SCF, 2013)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3502) took a random sample of 6,015 adult Canadians and collected information on their level of education and whether or not they own a home. The variables "Education Level" and "Home Ownership" are measured as follows:

### Education Level
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>No High School Diploma</li>
  <li>High School Diploma or GED</li>
  <li>Some College</li>
  <li>College Degree</li>
</ol>

### Home Ownership
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>Yes (Owns House/Condo/Ranch/Farm/Mobile Home/etc.)</li>
  <li>No (Otherwise)</li>
</ol>

## Data Analysis Steps

1. **Use Chrome or Firefox browsers** and download the following two files to your computer:
   - [Data file: Home_SCF2013.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aslemand/Data-Analysis-Activities/refs/heads/main/data/Activity_1/Home_SCF2013.csv)
   - [R Script: Home_SCF2013.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aslemand/Data-Analysis-Activities/refs/heads/main/data/Activity_1/Home_SCF2013.R)

2. Copy and paste this link into your web browser: [https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca](https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca) and select **RStudio**.

3. Log in using your **UTORid**.

4. In RStudio, in the file pane (bottom-right of the screen), create a folder name it `Stats Activities`. Inside this folder, create a sub-folder named `Activity 1`.

5. From the file location in RStudio, create a new project:
   - Name it `Home`.
   - Choose `Stats Activities > Activity 1` as the directory to save the project.

6. Upload the two downloaded files into your `Home` project folder.

7. Open the R script from your `Home` project folder.

8. Run each line of code in the R script.

9. Begin by reading/importing the data file in R.

10. Copy and paste each R output that appears in the R console (bottom-left pane) into a Word document or other text editor. Save your R outputs (your copied and pasted statistical results).

11. Modify the R script:
    - Between lines 124 and 143, make a small change to the R script. 
    - Insert your last name onto the bar plot in line 140.
    - Export and save your plot in your computer.

12. Upload your bar plot to the assignment page in Quercus. The accepted file formats in Quercus are: `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`.

## Related Questions about Data Analysis

1. Suppose we are interested in investigating the relationship between **home ownership** and **education level**:
   - Identify the response and explanatory variable.
   - Identify the role of each variable, their type, and their scale of measurement.

2. Find the marginal proportions of the response variable, convert them to percentages, and interpret.

3. Find the conditional proportions of the response variable for each category of the explanatory variable. Convert them to percentages and interpret.

4. Compute the difference between the proportion of homeownership for the "No High School Diploma" group and the "College Degree" group. Interpret this difference in context.

5. Compute the ratio between the proportion of homeownership for the "No High School Diploma" group and the "College Degree" group. Interpret this ratio in context.

6. Using data-based arguments (i.e., comparing conditional proportions), describe the relationship between the variables **"home ownership"** and **"education level"**.
