# Activity 1 - Exploring Categorical Data

## Context of Data

The [**Survey of Consumer Finances** (SCF, 2013)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3502) took a random sample of 6,015 adult Canadians and collected information on their level of education and whether or not they own a home. The variables "Education Level" and "Home Ownership" are measured as follows:

### Education Level
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>No High School Diploma</li>
  <li>High School Diploma or GED</li>
  <li>Some College</li>
  <li>College Degree</li>
</ol>

### Home Ownership
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>Yes (Owns House/Condo/Ranch/Farm/Mobile Home/etc.)</li>
  <li>No (Otherwise)</li>
</ol>

## R Steps

To complete this activity on your local computer with R and RStudio installed, follow these steps:

1. **Download the required files** to your computer using the following links:
   - [Data file: Home_SCF2013.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aslemand/Data-Analysis-Activities/refs/heads/main/data/Activity_1/Home_SCF2013.csv)
   - [R Script: Home_SCF2013.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aslemand/Data-Analysis-Activities/refs/heads/main/data/Activity_1/Home_SCF2013.R)

2. **Set up your project directory**:
   - Create a folder on your computer named `Stats Activities`.
   - Inside this folder, create a sub-folder named `Activity 1`.

3. **Start RStudio and create a new project**:
   - Open RStudio.
   - Go to `File > New Project > Existing Directory`.
   - Browse to the folder you created: `Stats Activities/Activity 1`.
   - Click `Create Project`.

4. **Upload the downloaded files**:
   - Copy the downloaded `Home_SCF2013.csv` and `Home_SCF2013.R` files into the `Activity 1` folder.

5. **Open the R script**:
   - In RStudio, open the `Home_SCF2013.R` file by selecting it from the `Files` tab (bottom-right pane).

6. **Run the R script line by line**:
   - Highlight each line of code in the script and click `Run` (top-right of the editor pane), or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) / `Cmd+Enter` (Mac).

7. **Begin data analysis**:
   - Start by reading/importing the data file into RStudio with the `read.csv()` function.
   - Examine the data structure and variable names as instructed in the R script.

8. **Copy R outputs**:
   - After running each line of code, copy the outputs from the R console (bottom-left pane) into a Word document or any text editor for submission or future reference.

9. **Modify the R script**:
   - Edit the script between lines 124 and 143.
   - Insert your last name onto the bar plot (line 140).

10. **Export your bar plot**:
    - Save your bar plot as a `.jpeg` or `.png` file. Use the `ggsave()` function or the `Export` button in RStudio's Plots pane.

11. **Submit your work**:
    - Save your bar plot as a `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` file.
    - Share the output with your instructor or teaching assistant for assessment, as per their preferred submission method.
