From the Better Life Index (BLI, 2021), a program conducted by OECD, you will analyze a quantitative variable named Social Network Support. This variable reflects the percentage of males and females aged 15 years and over in 41 OECD countries who perceive their social network as having relatives or friends that they can count on to help them in times of need and trouble. R Setup To set up and use R for this activity, follow the general instructions provided here: How to Access and Use R for Data Analysis Activities. Once you’ve set up your project and loaded the provided files, proceed with the activity-specific instructions below. Activity Instructions Open the R script Social.R and run it line by line in RStudio. Begin by reading/importing the data file Social.csv into R. Examine the data structure and variables using str() and summary statistics functions. Create side-by-side boxplots to compare distributions of Social Network Support percentages for males and females. Modify the plot title (line 86 in the R script) to include your last name. For example: box.plot &lt;- box.plot + labs(title = &quot;Boxplot of Data Constructed by You&quot;) Save the boxplot as a .jpeg or .png file. Related Questions After completing the activity, answer the following questions using your results: Refer to your statistical analysis of percentages of perceived social network support for males and females. Use side-by-side boxplots and summary statistics to compare the distributions. Compare the shapes, centers, and spreads of both distributions. Identify potential outliers using the 1.5IQR rule. For any outlier(s), determine how many standard deviations they are away from the overall mean of the distribution. Use the boxplot and summary statistics for the differences between females’ and males’ percentages of perceived social network support (in each country) to describe what this plot reveals that the side-by-side boxplots do not. Discuss the shape, center, and spread of the differences. Identify suspect outliers using the 1.5IQR rule and calculate their deviation from the overall mean. Explain why the boxplot of differences is more insightful for understanding differences between males and females across OECD countries.

Pre-Task Tutorial Activity Context of the Problem for Carrying Out Simulations Suppose STA123 course grades are Normally distributed. Instead of collecting data from students, we will simulate (generate) some data for our example. To simulate data, we need to know the population mean and standard deviation of STA123 course grades. Here we assume the mean STA123 course grades is 70 and the standard deviation is 5. Using the sampled data, we obtain a 95% CI for population mean STA123 course grades. Next, we carry out an experiment for CI interpretation. We know that a CI changes each time with a study. If we repeat the same study again and again, (1-\\(\\alpha\\))% of the time the obtained confidence intervals would cover the true population parameter value. This can be shown through a simulation study or experiment. Using the STA123 course grades example, we can conduct an experiment using the following steps: Generate a set of STA123 course grades data with 150 students from the population. Calculate the observed sample mean of STA123 course grades and the standard error of \\(\\bar{X}\\). Calculate the confidence interval. Check whether the confidence interval contains the population parameter value. Repeat steps (1)-(4) 10,000 times and count the total number of times that the confidence intervals contain the population value. For a 95% CI, one would expect about 9500 times the CIs contain the population value. Next, we draw a plot of the first 100 simulated confidence intervals and indicate those which do not contain the true population mean value of 70.
