It is intended for developing statistical reasoning at an introductory to an intermediate level by explaining patterns in the data, interpreting and communicating results within the context of data, and making data-based arguments and inference. Each chapter corresponds to one statistical activity with a set of learning objectives. Click on a link below to access a specific statistical activity. Activity 1: Exploring Categorical Data Activity 2 - Exploring Quantitative Data Activity 3 - Sampling Distributions Related to the Normal Population Activity 4 - Applications of Limit Theorem Activity 5 - Estimation with Confidence Intervals Activity 6 - Introduction to Hypothesis Testing and Concepts Activity 7 - Errors in Tests, Statistical Power and Sample Size Activity 8 - Comparing Groups Activity 9 - Analysis of Categorical Data Activity 10 - Correlation and Introduction to Simple Linear Regression Model Note: Solution to each statistical activity is shared at the instructor’s discretion.
