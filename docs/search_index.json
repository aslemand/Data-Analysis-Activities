It is intended for developing statistical reasoning at an introductory to an intermediate level by explaining patterns in the data, interpreting and communicating results within the context of data, and making data-based arguments and inference. Each chapter corresponds to one statistical activity with a set of learning objectives. Click on a link below to access a specific statistical activity.

The variables “Education Level” and “Home Ownership” are measured as follows: Education Level No High School Diploma High School Diploma or GED Some College College Degree Home Ownership Yes (Owns House/Condo/Ranch/Farm/Mobile Home/etc.) No (Otherwise) R Setup To set up and use R for this activity, follow the general instructions provided here: How to Access and Use R for Data Analysis Activities. Once you’ve set up your project and loaded the provided files, proceed with the activity-specific instructions below. Activity Instructions Open the R script Home_SCF2013.R along with the data set Home_SCF2013.csv and run it line by line in RStudio. Examine the data using the str() function to understand its structure and variable names. Generate and interpret bar plots to visualize the relationship between education level and home ownership. Modify the bar plot code (lines 124 to 143) to include your last name in the title: library(ggplot2) # Exercise. # We will construct a side-by-side (clustered) bar chart of the data # bar.plot is a name where we want to save the plot and its features # ggplot function will make a canvas, # and will make the plot ready using the data set and its variables of interest bar.plot = ggplot(Home2, aes(x = Education_Level, fill = Home_Ownership)) # We will add the bars to the plot of the data # As well, we will add the legends and position it to the right-hand side bar.plot = bar.plot + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) # We will add a label to the x-axis, # We will differentiate the bars by filling in the levels of the response variable # We will add a title and a subtitle to the plot # And, we will centre the position of both the title and the subtitle # Modify line 140 with your last-name in the subtitle bar.plot = bar.plot + labs(xlab = &quot;Education Level&quot;, fill = &quot;Home Ownership&quot;, title = &quot;Bar Plot of Home Ownership and Education Level&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Constructed by You&quot;) bar.plot = bar.plot + theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5)) bar.plot Save the modified bar plot as a .jpeg or .png file. Related Questions Suppose we are interested in investigating the relationship between home ownership and education level: Identify the response and explanatory variable. Identify the role of each variable, their type, and their scale of measurement. Find the marginal proportions of the response variable, convert them to percentages, and interpret. Find the conditional proportions of the response variable for each category of the explanatory variable. Convert them to percentages and interpret. Compute the difference between the proportion of homeownership for the “No High School Diploma” group and the “College Degree” group. Interpret this difference in context. Compute the ratio between the proportion of homeownership for the “No High School Diploma” group and the “College Degree” group. Interpret this ratio in context. Using data-based arguments (i.e., comparing conditional proportions), describe the relationship between the variables “home ownership” and “education level”. Submission Instructions Save your bar plot as a .doc, .pdf, .jpeg, or .png file. Provide your file to your instructor for feedback or assessment. "],["activity-2---exploring-quantitative-data.html", "Activity 2 - Exploring Quantitative Data Context of Data R Setup Activity Instructions Related Questions Submission Instructions", " Activity 2 - Exploring Quantitative Data Context of Data The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) gathers various information regarding OECD countries and its partners to promote policies that aim to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. From the Better Life Index (BLI, 2021), a program conducted by OECD, you will analyze a quantitative variable named Social Network Support. This variable reflects the percentage of males and females aged 15 years and over in 41 OECD countries who perceive their social network as having relatives or friends that they can count on to help them in times of need and trouble. R Setup To set up and use R for this activity, follow the general instructions provided here: How to Access and Use R for Data Analysis Activities. Once you’ve set up your project and loaded the provided files, proceed with the activity-specific instructions below. Activity Instructions Open the R script Social.R and run it line by line in RStudio. Begin by reading/importing the data file Social.csv into R. Examine the data structure and variables using str() and summary statistics functions. Create side-by-side boxplots to compare distributions of Social Network Support percentages for males and females. Modify the plot title (line 86 in the R script) to include your last name. For example: box.plot &lt;- box.plot + labs(title = &quot;Boxplot of Data Constructed by You&quot;) Save the boxplot as a .jpeg or .png file. Related Questions After completing the activity, answer the following questions using your results: Refer to your statistical analysis of percentages of perceived social network support for males and females. Use side-by-side boxplots and summary statistics to compare the distributions. Compare the shapes, centers, and spreads of both distributions. Identify potential outliers using the 1.5IQR rule. For any outlier(s), determine how many standard deviations they are away from the overall mean of the distribution. Use the boxplot and summary statistics for the differences between females’ and males’ percentages of perceived social network support (in each country) to describe what this plot reveals that the side-by-side boxplots do not. Discuss the shape, center, and spread of the differences. Identify suspect outliers using the 1.5IQR rule and calculate their deviation from the overall mean. Explain why the boxplot of differences is more insightful for understanding differences between males and females across OECD countries. Submission Instructions Save your boxplot of differences in percentages of perceived social support network as a .doc, .pdf, .jpeg, or .png file. Share your file with your instructor or teaching assistant for feedback or assessment.

R Setup To set up and use R for this activity, follow the general instructions provided here: How to Access and Use R for Data Analysis Activities. Once you’ve set up your project and loaded the provided files, proceed with the activity-specific instructions below. Activity Instructions Open the R script Newborn_Weights.R and start running the provided code. Modify the R code as follows: Line 7: Insert a unique seed number. # Enter your seed number in line 8. set.seed( ) Line 39: Add your last name to the title of the plot. # Make a change to line 40. Include your last name in the main (title) argument. hist(Xbar, main = &quot;Histogram of Sample Means \\n Conducted by You&quot;, xlab = &quot;Xbar: Sample Means for Total Weights (in grams) of New Borns&quot;, col = &quot;lavender&quot;) Simulate 100 samples of size \\(n = 30\\) from the population distribution of newborn weights. Store the means in a variable named Xbar. Construct a frequency histogram of the sampling distribution of sample means. Obtain summary statistics and interpret: Shape Center Spread Experiment with other sample sizes (\\(n = 2, 5, 15, 30, 100, 300\\)) using different replication numbers (\\(n = 1000\\)): Plot the sampling distributions of sample means for these sample sizes. Identify which sample size gives the smallest Standard Error. Related Questions After completing the activity, answer the following questions: Sampling Distribution Analysis: Using the boxplot and Normal QQ plot, describe the sampling distribution of your sampled data. Justify your answer with both visualizations. IQR Extrapolation: Refer to the summary statistics. Write a sentence that extrapolates the IQR for this sample into a statement about the population. Ensure your wording is precise. Sampling Distribution of Means: For \\(n = 30\\), describe the sampling distribution of sample means (shape, center, and spread). Use summary statistics and histogram to support your analysis. Effect of Sample Size: Compare sampling distributions for different sample sizes (\\(n = 2, 5, 15, 30, 100, 300\\)). Identify which sample size gives the smallest Standard Error and explain why.
